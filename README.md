# TauLabsWinPhone

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This is an attempt at a Windows Phone/Store implementation of a GCS for TauLabs.

It uses a UAVO/UAVTalk parser originally developed by @sparkie79 as part of his UavObject-.Net-Parser project.

It is not yet working, so don't expect anything. If you want to help out, fork it and send a pull request.

## TODO:

- [x] Split out the UavTalk and UavObjectParser libraries from @sparkie79's project
- [x] Test it out with a simple console app
- [ ] Create barebones WinPhone app using Bluetooth Serial for connectivity to the UAV
- [ ] more...
